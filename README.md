### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- media querie

### What I learned

I learned about working with the media querie which was challenging before and finally I grasped the concept, HTML position element and margins were also fun doing more practice with.

```css
 @media (min-width: 655px) {
    .container{
      max-width: 1440px;
      margin-top: 80px;
      margin-right: 20%;
      margin-bottom: 100px;
      margin-left: 40%;
    }
 }
```
### Continued development

-Media querie
-CSS position
-CSS display 
-CSS margins, padding
